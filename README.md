⚡ Forecasting the Future: Electricity Load and Price Prediction Based on Weather
This project develops a machine learning-based forecasting system to predict electricity load and prices using weather and temporal data. By applying models like LSTM and ARIMA, and visualizing the output via Streamlit, we aim to improve decision-making for energy distribution and pricing.

📌 Project Overview
Electricity consumption and prices are influenced by various factors such as temperature, humidity, time of day, and holidays. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning models to provide accurate forecasts for electricity demand and cost, helping energy providers and consumers optimize resources and reduce risk.

🎯 Objectives
Forecast electricity load and pricing trends using weather and time-based features.

Evaluate and compare LSTM (deep learning) and ARIMA (statistical) models.

Build an interactive Streamlit web app to demonstrate model predictions.

Support sustainable energy planning and operational efficiency.

 Technologies Used
Programming: Python

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
